# CSE 4705 – HW1 Search Algorithms (Grid World)

## Structure
- `grid.py` — shared grid, helpers, and dataclass for results
- `grid_search_bfs_dfs_ucs.py` — BFS, DFS, UCS (unit cost)
- `grid_search_ldfs_iddfs.py` — Depth-Limited DFS (DLDFS) and Iterative Deepening (IDDFS)
- `grid_search_astar.py` — A* with Manhattan heuristic
- `run_all.py` — convenience runner; also writes `summary.csv` which gives us the results we need
